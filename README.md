# Platformer Example

This example was created based on Dr. Long Nguyen's tutorial at https://longbaonguyen.github.io/courses/platformer/platformer.html.  

The orignal tutorial utilizes the Processing IDE.  In my example, I import the Processing Library into a traditional IDE instead of using the Processing IDE and modify the code accordingly.  The example utilizes loading maps from CSV files, animated sprites, and collision detection.

Use the left and right arrow keys to move, the a key to jump, and the shift key to run.
